#Problem Set 3

For scheduling periodic tasks, especially in a production environment, I would recommend using a reliable and scalable task scheduler like Celery combined with a message broker such as RabbitMQ or Redis.

<p>i'd prefer celery </p>

Reasons:

<p><b>Distributed Task Execution</b>: Celery allows for the distribution of tasks across multiple worker nodes, enabling parallel execution and efficient resource utilization.</p>

<p><b>Flexible Task Scheduling</b>: It provides a robust scheduling mechanism that supports periodic tasks, making it suitable for scenarios like downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours.</p>

<p>Message Brokers: Celery's integration</p>

<p>(B).i'd use flask instead of django when creating a single page website or landing page</p>
